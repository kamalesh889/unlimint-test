/**
Common description:
You need to write a program that gets webpages, extracts content length of a page and puts this value into the map.
When all address processed, program prints all pairs (webpage address, content length).

Specific requirements:

Worker is a function that receives webpage address (ex: "google.com") and gets page content.
Worker gets only basic html document and do not receive external resources like images, css and so on.
You need to create two workers (two go routines).
You need to use channel(s) to send webpage address to the workers.

On success, if it's possible to get webpage, put the length of webpage content into rusults.ContentLength map. Use as a key webpage address, and content length as the value.
On failure, if it's impossible to get webpage because some errors, put into the results.ContentLength webpage address as a key, and -1 as a value.

When all webpages from webPages slice processed, print each key-value from webPages.
Example:
google.com - 4501
...


The program's execution time should be configurable. If execution time is out, the program should gracefully shut all currently running workers.


You can modify provided sources as you wish. You can extend the results structure as you need just keep two provided fields in it.
